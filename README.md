Interact with the Spotify Web API in Swift

This app uses the Spotify Connect Web API to show the currently playing track for a logged in user and give playback controls.

### Authorization

This demo uses [SpotifyLogin](https://github.com/spotify/SpotifyLogin) for authentication and authorization. This library is intended for prototyping purposes only and should not be used in production apps.
